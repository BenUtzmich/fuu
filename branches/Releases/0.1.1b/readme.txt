-- [ Introduction ] --

This is the first buggy version of this little tool. This project borns just to show some functionality of TitanEngine SDK from Reversing Labs, but i hope
it can be more than that and in the future it would be a more useful and better tool.

Use it at your own risk!

-- [ What is FUU? ] --

It's a small IDE with plugins. Every plugin is a independent tool that can be used in another program of your choice :). 
You have plugins to unpack some very well known packers and some other extra known plugins like Generic OEP finder, Generic Unpacker and
a Crypto Analysis tool.

-- [ How to use it ] --

Just open the packed file, select the plugin you wish and press the 'Unpack' button.

-- [ Credits and thanks ] --
